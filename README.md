# Youtube to mp3

This python script converts youtube videos to mp3.

## Getting Started

Simply call the script with option -h and you'll see the usage info. The only argument needed is -l <youtube link>.

### Prerequisites

To run this script, you'll need [youtube_dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/blob/master/youtube_dl/YoutubeDL.py#L129-L279). I tested with version 2017.7.9.

## Running the tests

To run the unittests, simply call python -m unittest test.test_youtube_to_mp3.py.
